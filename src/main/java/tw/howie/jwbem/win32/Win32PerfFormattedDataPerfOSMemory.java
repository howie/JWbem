/**
 * The Win32PerfFormattedDataPerfOSMemory formatted data class provides pre-calculated performance data from performance counters
 * that monitor the physical and virtual memory on the computer.
 * 
 * @author akutz
 * @remarks <p>
 *          Physical memory is the amount of random access memory (RAM) on the computer. Virtual memory consists of space in
 *          physical memory and on disk. Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data
 *          between disk and physical memory. Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which interfere
 *          with all system processes.
 *          </p>
 *          <p>
 *          This class represents the Memory object in System Monitor and returns the same data you see in System Monitor. The
 *          original data source is the PerfOS performance library. The corresponding raw data class is
 *          Win32PerfRawDataPerfOSMemory. Data is dynamically provided for this class from the performance library object by the
 *          WmiPerfInst provider.
 *          </p>
